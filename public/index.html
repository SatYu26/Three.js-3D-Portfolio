        <h2>📜 Get to know Me!</h2>
        <p>
          Hi There! I'm Satyam Goyal, a Flutter developer, React Web Developer
          and open source contributor based in India. I have been developing
          Android apps for over 1.5 years now, and have recently created many
          React based projects also. I have worked in teams for various startups
          as an Intern and helped them in launching their prototypes, as open
          source contributor at GitHub and got valuable learning experience.<br />Right
          now I'm in third year of my undergraduate degree at SRM Institute of
          Science and Technology, active Google Developer Student Clubs (DSC)
          Core Member, and Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador.
